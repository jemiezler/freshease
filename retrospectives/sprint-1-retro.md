Sprint 1 Retrospective – FreshEase

What Went Well
	•	Most planned tasks were finished on time; we delivered the browse → cart → checkout flow and the demo worked end-to-end.
	•	No critical bugs reached users; issues were caught in staging and fixed quickly.


What Didn’t Go Well
	•	Tasks weren’t clearly defined at the start, so different people had different ideas of “done.”
	•	Ownership was unclear on a few items, causing pauses or duplicate edits on the same files.
	•	Communication was scattered across chats/DMs; some decisions were missed and caused rework.

What to Improve
	•	Write clear acceptance criteria and a simple “done” checklist for every task (inputs, steps, expected result).
	•	Break big tasks into smaller sub-tasks with one owner and a target date.
	•	Lock priorities at sprint start; if new work appears, trade off by moving something out.
	•	Use one main channel for updates and keep a short mid-sprint sync to catch changes early.
